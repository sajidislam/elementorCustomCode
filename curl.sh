#First, retrieve your user URI:

curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/users/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

From the response, extract your user URI, which should look something like https://api.calendly.com/users/YOUR_USER_UUID.

Then, use this URI to make the request for scheduled events:
'
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/scheduled_events?user=https://api.calendly.com/users/YOUR_USER_UUID \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

Replace YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN and YOUR_USER_UUID with your actual token and user UUID, respectively. This should get you the scheduled events for your user profile.

Also, ensure that you have the correct scope for your Personal Access Token. For accessing scheduled events, you probably need the event:read scope. If you don't have the necessary scope, you might need to regenerate or create a new Personal Access Token with the required permissions.
