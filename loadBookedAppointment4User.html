/*
11Nov23 - This HTML code can be placed in a Thank You or similar page after
the visitor has completed a booking event through calendly calendar that 
was embedded in a previous HTML page.

TO DO:
1. Make sure the folder "custom-scripts" exists under public_html (i.e at the same level as wp-config.php file)
2. Make sure that the file script.php exists inside of custom-scripts folder
3. Make sure that the permissions are correct so that it can be read
4. Update script.php and enter your Calendly access token and UUID
5. If you need help to figure these 2 out then there is a YouTube video to do that
6. Keep access token and UUID secure

Future TO DO:
a. Add additional security to script to php so that it can only be executed from WordPress
b. May be turn this feature into a plugin

    .then(data => {
        document.getElementById('calendlyData').textContent = data.message;
